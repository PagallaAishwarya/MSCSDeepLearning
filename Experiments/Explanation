These Experiments are training Models, for Sentence analysis using Keras Libraries. There are five different rules based on English Grammer used to write this algorithm. Each experiment is training one of the rules.
- Using glove 6b all dimensions (50, 100, 200, 300)
- maximum lenghts : 10, 110, 400
- different losses and activation functions
